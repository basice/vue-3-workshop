Ben discusses an overview of what Vue is and why to consider using Vue, including Vue being approachable, performant, versatile, community-first, and enterprise proven. A brief demonstration of some applications that use Vue is also included in this segment.

### Creating a Vue App

_00:14:16 - 00:20:51_
Ben briefly discusses prerequisite knowledge for creating a Vue app and walks through how to create a base Vue application without using any build tools. Vue is being used directly from a CDN by placing a script tag into the HTML and can be configured via a defined configuration object.

### Directives

_00:20:52 - 00:32:32_
Ben demonstrates using unique attributes with the v- prefix called directives, including `v-if`, `v-else`, and `v-for`, to reactively apply updates to the DOM when the value of its expression changes. Student questions regarding differences between Vue 2 and Vue 3, why the `v-for` directive is on the `li` element instead of the `ul` element, and if the data attribute is required are also covered in this segment.

### Getting Started with Vue Exercise

_00:32:33 - 00:40:19_
Students are instructed to choose a TV show and use their newly gained knowledge of directives to create an HTML page, reactive data for characters on the show, and render an empty state if no characters exist. Ben then walks through a possible solution to the exercise, including a new syntax for returning data.

### Getting Started Q&A

_00:40:20 - 00:48:38_
Ben answers student questions regarding if the if...else statement can be extended, if there are any gotchas with namespacing the characterList, and if characterList is globally available. How to render the characterList as a string instead of a list is also covered in this segment.

### Event Handling & View Model

_00:48:39 - 01:01:58_
Ben demonstrates handling events in Vue, defining methods, and using the `v-on` and `v-bind` directives to call those methods to add interactivity to the page. The `v-model` directive can be used in place of `v-on` and `v-bind` to create a two-way binding.

### Event Handling Q&A

### Composables Exercise

_05:15:27 - 05:21:56_
Students are instructed to create a composables folder in the `src` directory, analyze the app to locate a shareable piece of state or functionality, and create a file called `useState.js` / `useFunction.js`. Ben then walks through a possible solution to the composables exercise.

## 7. Styling Components

### Global vs. Scoped Styles

_05:21:57 - 05:26:27_
Ben demonstrates how to define global and scoped styling in a Vue application. Scoped styles take relevant component elements and append a unique data attribute.

### CSS Modules

_05:26:28 - 05:31:38_
Ben demonstrates applying the module mode to CSS styles to allow scoping styles to components. The selected class gets recompiled with a generated hash attached to define the scope.
